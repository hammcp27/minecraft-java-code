Good morning, Githubers!

<strong>Hello ðŸ‘‹, Throughout Majix WebServer lifetime many things have happened including near shutdowns of the service. Unfortunately all good things must come to a end,  "Majix WebServer" has been blocked in the main county this service was built for and with that all development of "Majix WebServer" is suspended. It will most likely be working fully again in Q4 or 2025-2026 school year if development continues.</strong>

I know this is not what you all wanted to hear from me however I think it would be wise to allow myself to cool down within the school and take a break. <strong>Starting 02/04/25 All development will cease.</strong> I will be working on other projects the Majix source code is public if you would like to make your own twist of Majix.

<strong>Thank you for all the great memories of Majix WebServer, And thank you to everyone who used Majix for all of the gaming needs</strong>

<Strong>Majix Site will be down on 02/10/2025</strong>

Have a wonderful year,
<h4>Majix</h4>
